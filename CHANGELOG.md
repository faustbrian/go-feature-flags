# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The project follows Semantic
Versioning.

## Unreleased

### Documentation

- Replace archived monorepo and hardening terminology with package-owned
  documentation and verification guidance.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-25

### Compatibility

- Regenerate the exported API baseline with the repository's Go 1.26
  toolchain so structured JSON values retain their intended stable identity.

### Changed

- Exclude intentional nested modules from root local-proxy archives so local,
  bootstrap, CI, and public module checksums describe the same source
  boundary.

- Track the pinned documentation-tool lockfile so clean CI checkouts install
  the exact validated cspell dependency.

- Reconcile standalone dependency checksums against deterministic current
  module archives so CI, local verification, and release consumers resolve
  identical content.

- Harden standalone documentation validation with deterministic spelling and
  link checks, package-specific documentation gates, and repository-local
  contributor guidance.

### Changed

- Publish the module from its standalone `github.com/faustbrian/go-feature-flags` identity while preserving its documented API and behavior.

### Documentation

- Link the package README to package-owned documentation.

### Security

- Upgrade `golang.org/x/text` to v0.41.0 and `golang.org/x/sys` to v0.47.0 so
  the dependency graph no longer contains GO-2026-5970 or GO-2026-5024.

### Compatibility

- Added a pinned module export baseline so incompatible public API changes
  fail the canonical repository gate.

- Added strict native values, deterministic strategies, groups, dependencies,
  immutable tenant snapshots, batch evaluation, and safe diagnostics.
- Added memory, PostgreSQL, and Valkey providers with shared conformance,
  optimistic concurrency, audit, staging, cleanup, and import/export.
- Added bounded fail-open or fail-closed caching and an optional OpenFeature
  evaluation adapter.
- Added explicit fleet bootstrap, immutable last-known-good metadata, bounded
  refresh and invalidation convergence, per-flag degraded policy, deterministic
  replica jitter, resilience composition seams, and joined shutdown semantics.
- Added caller-owned invalidation watchers with bounded failure classification
  and shutdown joining, plus concurrent cold-pod overload recovery semantics.
